# Data Sience Projects (Masters of Business Administration at FIAP)

## Machine Learning Projects:

### 1) Feature Engineering:
1.1- Feature Scaling: Kaggle Housing dataset. This project focuses on a pipeline that utilizes Gradient Descent (SGD Regression) and Linear Regression, with or without feature scaling, to compare the results.

1.2- Dimensionality Reduction: Kaggle Breast Cancer dataset. This project focuses on comparing prediction results with or without dimensionality reduction, utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in conjunction with the Random Forest model.

1.3- Feature Extraction, Store e Selection: 
  
  First, the cellphone dataset from Kaggle was used to explain three important aspects for better selection, which are:
    
    a) Univariate Selection - a type of selection using a statistical metric (such as Chi-square, R2 score, recall, f1);
    
    b) Through Importance - meaning, I examine the attributes with the highest importance scores; and
    
    c) Correlation Matrix, Heatmap, or Covariance Matrix: a graph where we observe density and select those attributes with the highest correlation.

  Second, the Kaggle SpamCollection dataset was used to illustrate feature extraction in the context of text data. Techniques such as TfIdf Vectorizer and Linear SVC models were employed.

1.4- Backward and Forward Feature Selection: Boston Housing Dataset. Utilizing the Sequential Feature Selector to select backward and forward features and compare the results.
